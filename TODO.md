# To Implement

- Add querying via the Semantic Scholar API per [Claudia Hauff's paper-note-filler](https://github.com/chauff/paper-note-filler)
    - Motivation: S2's API has entries for ACL papers
    - Signpost: You can directly consult the [S2 API documentation](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/#tag/Paper-Data/operation/get_graph_get_paper), as well as [tutorial](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api%2Ftutorial)
- Add support for OpenReview per [this snippet/Gist from vzhong](https://gist.github.com/vzhong/9d6358b8fb1c63e801cd53c01ffa1af8)
